If for some reason any apk's aren't installing correctly
or Android Studio is trying to uninstall some, I found a solution
that can fix it:

1. File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment.

2. Instant Run -> disable "Enable Instant Run to hot swap code/resource changes on deploy".

3. Apply -> OK

Once this setting is fixed, clean the project (Build -> Clean project)
to get the app to run. Once it's clean, you can re-enable the
instant run setting to get that functionality working again. Hopefully,
you won't have to use this trick, but if the issue comes up here is
how I managed to get around it.
