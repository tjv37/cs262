1.1) The Basic Activity template provides a toggle switch
     for a setting, but the Settings Activity template provides
     a pre-populated settings menu with different setting groups.

1.2) Task 1 uses the Basic Activity template to tie a setting to a
     certain value and creates a brand new app to demonstrate this.
     Task 2 uses the Settings Activity template to make a multi-
     level settings menu in our existing Droid Cafe app that we 
     created in lab two weeks ago.

2.5.i) Testing the app on a larger screen devices ensures that the
       settings activity we created correctly uses the master/detail
       screen layout (i.e. a header link for each group on the left
       and the group of associated settings on the right).

2.5.ii) The fragments are defined in an activity's layout file.
        They're defined quite similarly to views.
