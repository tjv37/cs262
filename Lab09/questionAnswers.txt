Lab09 Questions

a. How many API endpoints does this application support and where are they implemented?
	The application supports multiple endpoints. One is in hello.java as a GET method, and multiple are in the 
	PlayerResource.java file. In that file, there are GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE methods that interact with the server database.

b. PlayerResource.java
	i. What is the Java-based technology used to access data from a database?
		The Java-based methods for interacting with the database are HTTP GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. These allow 
		you to read the data and manipulate it.

	ii. Compare and contrast the following:
		1. SQL query statements vs. JDBC statement objects
			The difference between the two is the fact that SQL query statements 
			just interact with the database while JDBC statement objects are used to interact with Java.

		2. SQL relations vs. JDBC result sets vs. List<Player>
			List<Player> has no connections between its elements while an SQL relation is a table with multiple tuples
			that represent rows. A JDBC result sets is like a table, but it can only look through it one row at a time. 
 
	iii. Under what circumstances would the function getValueStringOrNull() be used?
		The function would be used When you want to get a string from a table but it may not actually exist.
		If it doesn't, it returns null, and if it does it returns the desired string in quotes.

c. Player.java
	i. What purpose does this Player DAO serve?
		This provides an object-oriented way to represent and manipulate player "objects" from the traditional 
		(non-object-oriented) Monopoly database.

	ii. How does it compare with the Player table?
		It is object oriented while the Player table isn't.
